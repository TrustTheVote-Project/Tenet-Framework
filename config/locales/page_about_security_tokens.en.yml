        title: How to use Security Tokens
        body: >
          <p>A Security Token is a unique code that is used instead of a password
          during log in. Each token expires after a few minutes, and is specific to your
          admin account. This provides increased protection against unauthorized
          access.</p>

          <h4>Obtaining a Security Token</h4>

          <p>To obtain Security Tokens for the first
          time, you’ll need to create an SSH Key Pair. (Scroll down for instructions.)
          Security Tokens are then available on your computer by one of two methods:</p>

          <ol>
            <li><strong>SoftToken App</strong><br/>
              Run the TrustTheVote SoftToken App, and copy&paste the displayed
              Security Token into the log in screen. Download for Windows, Mac, or Linux</li>

            <li><strong>Terminal</strong><br/>
              Open the Terminal app on your computer and enter the following
              command:<br/><br/>
              <pre>ssh st@bb-app.com</pre><br/>
              You’ll receive a response that looks like:<br/><br/>
              <pre>Security Token: yghr24308hr214rh</pre><br/>
              Copy &amp; paste the returned Security Token into the log in screen.</li>
          </ol>

          <h4>First-time Setup: Creating an SSH Key Pair</h4>

          <p>Before you can use Security Tokens, you’ll need to create an SSH Key Pair and send the
          <strong>Public Key</strong> to the sys-admin of your account. There are two key creation
          methods:</p>

          <ol>
            <li><strong>SoftToken App</strong><br/>
            Download, install, and run the app. Select a pass phrase for the app. Keep this secure. Then generate a new SSH Key Pair. Copy
          the Public Key into an email and send it to the sys-admin of your account.</li>

            <li><strong>Terminal</strong><br/>
            Open the Terminal app on your computer and enter the following command: ....</li>
          </ol>
